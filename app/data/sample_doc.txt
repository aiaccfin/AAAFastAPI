FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
It is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic.

FastAPI supports asynchronous programming and automatic OpenAPI generation.
It is widely used in production for AI and machine learning systems.

RAG systems often use FastAPI to orchestrate ingestion, retrieval, and inference.
